This does not compile, because you cannot reference a non-final variable in an anonymous class' method. When you add a final modifier to the declaration of a, the value of a would be copied into the created instance of the anonymous class you have defined. However, you will not be allowed to change the value of a, because the changes would not be visible to the method where a was declared.
